DONE
Prototype #1: 20x20 board grid with each square having a red circle inside it. Pac-man is a yellow square that is able to move around the screen when user presses up, down, left, or right keys. When Pac-man moves to a square with a red dot, the red dot disappears and the user's score is incremented. Ghost is a pink square. When Pac-man's position overlaps with the ghost's position, the user is alerted that they have ran into a ghost and lost.

Prototype #2: Pause and unpause game with spacebar. Add gifs for the Pac-man and ghost squares.Simulate random movement of the ghost on the board within the borders of the board.


IN PROGRESS
Prototype #3: Add New Game button. Highest score determine from game history and how to user. Don't let pac-man or the ghost to be able to run off the board.
