Your process/approach:
I first started planning the game by research the actual Pac-man game, looking at their rules, and playing the game, then I wrote my user stories and created my first wireframe. Each sprint of the project contained a prototype that I wanted to accomplish (as described in ../documentation/prototypes/prototypes.md). On my Trello Board I broke down each prototype into the steps I needed to do in order to get to the desired prototype.

Your biggest wins and challenges:


The game you chose: Pac-man (slightly modified from original)


The rules of the game:
(Source: http://www.pacxon.net/pacman-rules.php)
- Pacman, our hero, munches his way around the room, eating all of the Pac-dots.
- In each corner of the room there is a "Power Pellet", which when Pacman eats one, the Ghosts turn blue or yellow.
- Pacman can get extra points by eating the Ghosts. The first one is worth 200 points and each additional Ghost eaten is worth double the number of points.
- When the player reaches 10,000 points, he gets an additional life - but that only happens once during the game.

Your process for turning that game into a web application (wireframes, blockers/issues that popped up):
