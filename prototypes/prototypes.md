DONE
Prototype #1: 20x20 board grid with each square having a red circle inside it. Pac-man is a yellow square that is able to move around the screen when user presses up, down, left, or right keys. When Pac-man moves to a square with a red dot, the red dot disappears and the user's score is incremented. Ghost is a pink square. When Pac-man's position overlaps with the ghost's position, the user is alerted that they have ran into a ghost and lost.

Prototype #2: Record highest score. Pause and unpause game with spacebar. Add gifs for the Pac-man and ghost squares.



IN PROGRESS
Prototype #3: Simulate random movement of the ghost on the board within the borders of the board. Add New Game button. Highest score determine from game history and how to user. Don't let pac-man or the ghost to be able to run off the board.
