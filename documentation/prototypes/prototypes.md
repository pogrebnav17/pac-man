DONE
Prototype #1: 20x20 board grid with each square having a red circle inside it. Pac-man is a yellow square that is able to move around the screen when user presses up, down, left, or right keys. When Pac-man moves to a square with a red dot, the red dot disappears and the user's score is incremented. Ghost is a pink square. When Pac-man's position overlaps with the ghost's position, the user is alerted that they have ran into a ghost and lost.

Prototype #2: Pause and unpause game with spacebar. Add gifs for the Pac-man and ghost squares. Simulate random movement of the ghost on the board within the borders of the board.

Prototype #3: New Game button lets the user restart the game but keeps the score they have achieved. Highest score determine from game history and how to user. Ghost chases pac-man based on his location.

Prototype #4: Have ghost only skip the divs not add on the dot divs as it goes. Don't let pac-man or the ghost to be able to run off the board. Instructions button shows/hides the instructions of the game. Pac-man turns the correct direction toward the circles when moving. Pac-man is also disabled from moving when the space bar is hit.

Prototype #5: Add a maze (borders and 4 exits) to the game and set rules for it. Pac-man and ghost cannot cross walls, but will return on the same line on the opposite side if the leave the board through one of the gaps in the wall.


Prototype #6: Game has 4 levels (Level 0, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3) with varying speeds for the ghost, which increase as the level increases. When a user reaches a certain amount of points and levels up, the game is paused game and "Level up!" message is displayed to user. If the user loses, game is paused, "Game over" is displayed and the game restart after 3 seconds. Game is centered on the page with margins and is responsive.
