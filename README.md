The rules of the game:
(Source: http://www.pacxon.net/pacman-rules.php)
- Pacman, our hero, munches his way around the room, eating all of the Pac-dots.
- In each corner of the room there is a "Power Pellet", which when Pacman eats one, the Ghosts turn blue or yellow.
- Pacman can get extra points by eating the Ghosts. The first one is worth 200 points and each additional Ghost eaten is worth double the number of points.
- When the player reaches 10,000 points, he gets an additional life - but that only happens once during the game.

Your process for turning that game into a web application (wireframes, blockers/issues that popped up):
