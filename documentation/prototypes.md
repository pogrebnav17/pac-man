Prototype #1: 20x20 board grid with each square having a red circle inside it. Pac-man is a yellow square that is able to move around the screen when user presses up, down, left, or right keys. When Pac-man moves to a square with a red dot, the red dot disappears and the user's score is incremented. Ghost is a pink square. When Pac-man's position overlaps with the ghost's position, the user is alerted that they have ran into a ghost and lost.

Next prototype focus: Simulate random movement of the ghost on the board within the borders of the board.

Prototype #2: Ghost moves randomly around the board. New Game button. Highest score determine from game history and how to user.
